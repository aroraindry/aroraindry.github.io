I"T<p>You won’t believe the crazy stunt I pulled the other day! I was just trying to get a borrowed item back from a friend, but things took a turn for the wild when I remembered they kept an unloaded gun in their room. I figured I’d use it as a little negotiating tool, but little did I know, there was a stray bullet in the chamber.</p>
