I"ß<p>Growing up, life wasnâ€™t always easy. As a teenager, I had to do whatever it took to help make ends meet for my family, even if it meant getting my hands dirty. But I didnâ€™t mind â€“ work was no shame to me.</p>

<p>One of the jobs I took on was selling vegetables on the street. Every day, I would bike to a farm several miles away to pick up fresh produce, then sell it on the side of the road. It wasnâ€™t the most glamorous job, but it was a way for me to contribute to my familyâ€™s financial stability.</p>

<p>Looking back, those early experiences taught me the value of hard work and determination. They also instilled in me a sense of pride in earning my own way. No matter what obstacles come my way, I know that I have the resilience and grit to overcome them.</p>

<p>So to all the teenagers out there who may be facing similar challenges â€“ donâ€™t be afraid to roll up your sleeves and put in the work. It may not always be easy, but it will be worth it in the end.</p>
