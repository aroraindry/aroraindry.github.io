I"Ý<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>My name is Indra Mohan Arora, but you can call me Indry. I am a father of two amazing children and a husband to a sweet-and-salty wife. I have always enjoyed sharing my experiences with others and have decided to create this blog as a platform to do so. Here, you will find a variety of posts about incidents from my life that I hope you will find interesting. Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoy reading my posts.</p>

<p>Best,
Indry</p>
