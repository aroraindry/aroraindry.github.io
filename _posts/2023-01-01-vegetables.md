Growing up, life wasn't always easy. As a teenager, I had to do whatever it took to help make ends meet for my family, even if it meant getting my hands dirty. But I didn't mind – work was no shame to me.

One of the jobs I took on was selling vegetables on the street. Every day, I would bike to a farm several miles away to pick up fresh produce, then sell it on the side of the road. It wasn't the most glamorous job, but it was a way for me to contribute to my family's financial stability.

Looking back, those early experiences taught me the value of hard work and determination. They also instilled in me a sense of pride in earning my own way. No matter what obstacles come my way, I know that I have the resilience and grit to overcome them.

So to all the teenagers out there who may be facing similar challenges – don't be afraid to roll up your sleeves and put in the work. It may not always be easy, but it will be worth it in the end.
