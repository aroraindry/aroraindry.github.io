				<title>Vegetables I did sell proudly</title>

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up, life wasn’t always easy. As a teenager, I had to do whatever it took to help make ends meet for my family, even if it meant getting my hands dirty. But I didn’t mind – work was no shame to me.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The gun incident</title>
				
					<dc:creator>Blake</dc:creator>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;You won’t believe the crazy stunt I pulled the other day! I was just trying to get a borrowed item back from a friend, but things took a turn for the wild when I remembered they kept an unloaded gun in their room. I figured I’d use it as a little negotiating tool, but little did I know, there was a stray bullet in the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
