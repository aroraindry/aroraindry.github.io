As a teenager, I had to do whatever it took to help make ends meet for my family, even if it meant getting my hands dirty. But I didn’t mind – work was no shame to me.</p>

<p>One of the jobs I took on was selling vegetables on the street. Every day, I would bike to a farm several miles away to pick up fresh produce, then sell it on the side of the road. It wasn’t the most glamorous job, but it was a way for me to contribute to my family’s financial stability.</p>

<p>Looking back, those early experiences taught me the value of hard work and determination. They also instilled in me a sense of pride in earning my own way. No matter what obstacles come my way, I know that I have the resilience and grit to overcome them.</p>

<p>So to all the teenagers out there who may be facing similar challenges – don’t be afraid to roll up your sleeves and put in the work. It may not always be easy, but it will be worth it in the end.</p>]]></content><author><name>Blake</name></author><category term="about" /><category term="sample" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Growing up, life wasn’t always easy.

<p>Let’s just say, my friend won’t be forgetting the sound of that gun going off anytime soon. And as for me?

<p>My name is Indra Mohan Arora, but you can call me Indry. I am a father of two amazing children and a husband to a sweet-and-salty wife. I have always enjoyed sharing my experiences with others and have decided to create this blog as a platform to do so. Here, you will find a variety of posts about incidents from my life that I hope you will find interesting. Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoy reading my posts.</p>
